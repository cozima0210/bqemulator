    SELECT-list alias of the same name — the opposite priority of
    BigQuery's "GROUP BY <alias>" feature, which always means "group
    by this SELECT-list slot" regardless of what real column shares
    its name. When a query aliases 2+ output columns to names that
    also exist as real columns reachable through >=3 joins (e.g.
    ``pr.id AS project_id`` alongside a real ``processes.project_id``
    two joins closer to the FROM clause), the naive alias-as-written
    SQL either mis-resolves silently to the wrong column or trips
    DuckDB's "column ... must appear in the GROUP BY clause" binder
    error outright. ``SQLTranslator._expand_group_by_aliases_to_ordinals``
    rewrites such items to their 1-based SELECT-list ordinal before the
    DuckDB SQL is finalized, which is unambiguous — an ordinal maps
    directly to the SELECT list, no name resolution involved — and
    preserves exactly what "GROUP BY <alias>" means.
